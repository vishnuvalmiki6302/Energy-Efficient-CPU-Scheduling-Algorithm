# Energy-Efficient-CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm
 Energy-Efficient CPU Scheduling Algorithm in C language using Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Idle Power Management to optimize power consumption without compromising performance. The algorithm dynamically adjusts CPU frequency based on workload demands, ensuring energy efficiency for mobile and embedded systems. The code is simple yet effective, featuring power-aware scheduling logic and low-power idle state management. Follow the provided instructions to compile and run the program, observing its efficient power control in real-time task execution.
 Power-Aware Priority Scheduling algorithm in C, designed for efficient CPU scheduling in mobile and embedded systems. The algorithm sorts processes based on their priority, with higher-priority tasks executed first. In cases where two processes have the same priority, the one with lower power consumption is preferred to enhance energy efficiency. The program calculates the total energy consumption by multiplying each process's burst time with its power consumption rate. This solution effectively balances performance with energy optimization, making it ideal for power-constrained environments.

This project implements an Idle Power Management System using Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) in C to reduce CPU power consumption. The system detects idle periods lasting 3 consecutive seconds and dynamically scales the CPU frequency from 3.0 GHz (active) to 0.5 GHz (idle) for energy savings. It features simple logic for effective power management and restores maximum performance when CPU activity resumes. The code is easy to compile and run, making it suitable for integration into larger CPU scheduling algorithms for improved energy efficiency.
